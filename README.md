## Development Steps

### Phase 1 — Set up your environment
1. Install Python 3.10+.
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   - `PyQt6`
   - `SQLAlchemy`
   - `PyMySQL`
   - `requests` (for LLM API)
   - `cryptography` (for AES-256 email credential storage)
   - `imaplib` (already in stdlib)
3. Install MySQL 8.0 locally and confirm connectivity.
4. Obtain an LLM API key (OpenAI or Gemini) and test a simple API call.

### Phase 2 — Design and create the database schema
1. Define tables for:
   - `users` (student/admin)
   - `companies` (name, role, year, package)
   - `interview_rounds` (round type, difficulty per company)
   - `topics` (name, category, tags)
   - `company_topics` (junction table)
   - `question_bank`
   - `student_progress` (topics marked done by students)
   - `llm_cache` (cached summaries with timestamps)
2. ER Diagram:

### Phase 3 — Build the authentication and student-facing UI
1. Create a PyQt6 skeleton with:
   - Login window
   - First-launch credential setup screen (for email)
   - Main window with a sidebar
2. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for students and admins.

### Phase 4 — Core features: email parsing + LLM roadmap generation
1. Build an IMAP email parser using `imaplib` to scan institutional emails for placement-related information.
2. Extract and store data (company name, role, OA date, deadline) in MySQL.
3. Integrate LLM API to generate preparation roadmaps based on stored data.
4. Cache LLM responses for efficiency.

### Phase 5 — Admin panel
1. Develop admin-only views for:
   - Company CRUD operations
   - Question/topic database editor
   - Analytics dashboard (e.g., most-viewed companies, topic completion rates)
2. Ensure admin functions are gated behind your RBAC check.

### Phase 6 — Progress tracking
1. Add a topic-marking UI for each company's preparation screen.
2. Update the `student_progress` table and recalculate completion percentages in real time.
3. Display progress bars on the main dashboard.

### Phase 7 — Testing, documentation, and packaging
1. Write unit tests for core logic (email parser, LLM cache logic, progress calculation).
2. Create user and admin manuals.
3. Provide a `requirements.txt` and setup/install guide.
4. Package the app for easy installation on Windows or Ubuntu.
